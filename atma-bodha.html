      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-200 mb-4">Atma Bodha is a profound text that systematically unfolds the nature of the Self (Atman) and its identity with Brahman. Composed by Adi Shankaracharya, it serves as a guide for seekers of truth who wish to realize their true nature.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Verse 1 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">1</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">I am composing the ATMA-BODHA, this treatise of the Knowledge of the Self, for those who have purified themselves by austerities and are peaceful in heart and calm, who are free from cravings and are desirous of liberation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Shankara declares his intention to compose this text for qualified seekers - those who have purified themselves through spiritual practices, who are serene, free from worldly desires, and earnestly seeking liberation (moksha).</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 2 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">2</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">Just as the fire is the direct cause for cooking, so without Knowledge no emancipation can be had. Compared with all other forms of discipline Knowledge of the Self is the one direct means for liberation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Just as fire alone can cook food, only Self-knowledge (not rituals or worship alone) can bring liberation. While other spiritual practices are helpful, direct knowledge of one's true nature is the most immediate path to freedom.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 3 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">3</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">Action cannot destroy ignorance, for it is not in conflict with or opposed to ignorance. Knowledge does verily destroy ignorance as light destroys deep darkness.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Actions (karma) and ignorance exist in different domains - like darkness and a physical object that don't interact. Only knowledge (like light) can remove ignorance (darkness). Karma may give temporary results but cannot remove the root ignorance of our true nature.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 4 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">4</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">The Soul appears to be finite because of ignorance. When ignorance is destroyed the Self which does not admit of any multiplicity truly reveals itself by itself: like the Sun when the clouds pass away.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Self (Atman) only appears limited due to ignorance. When ignorance is removed through knowledge, the infinite, non-dual nature of the Self becomes self-evident, just as the sun is revealed when clouds disperse.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 5 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">5</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">Constant practice of knowledge purifies the Self ('Jivatman'), stained by ignorance and then disappears itself - as the powder of the'Kataka-nut' settles down after it has cleansed the muddy water.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Just as kataka nut powder (used to purify water) settles after cleansing, the knowledge that removes ignorance also disappears after its purpose is served, leaving only the pure Self.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 6 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">6</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">The world which is full of attachments, aversions, etc., is like a dream. It appears to be real, as long as it continues but appears to be unreal when one is awake (i.e., when true wisdom dawns).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The world of duality (with likes/dislikes) seems real while we're in it, just as a dream seems real while dreaming. Upon awakening to wisdom, its illusory nature becomes clear.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 7 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">7</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">The Jagat appears to be true (Satyam) so long as Brahman, the substratum, the basis of all this creation, is not realised. It is like the illusion of silver in the mother-of pearl.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The world appears real until we realize Brahman as its substratum, just as mother-of-pearl can be mistaken for silver in dim light. The illusion vanishes with proper knowledge.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 8 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">8</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">Like bubbles in the water, the worlds rise, exist and dissolve in the Supreme Self, which is the material cause and the prop of everything.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> All worlds emerge from, exist in, and dissolve back into the Supreme Self (like bubbles in water). The Self is both the material and sustaining cause of all creation.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 9 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">9</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">All the manifested world of things and beings are projected by imagination upon the substratum which is the Eternal All-pervading Vishnu, whose nature is Existence-Intelligence; just as the different ornaments are all made out of the same gold.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The diverse world is imagined upon the one Reality (Vishnu/Brahman), just as various ornaments are forms of the same gold. The substratum remains unchanged while names/forms appear.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 10 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">10</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">The All-pervading Akasa appears to be diverse on account of its association with various conditionings (Upadhis) which are different from each other. Space becomes one on the destruction of these limiting adjuncts: So also the Omnipresent Truth appears to be diverse on account of Its association with the various Upadhis and becomes one on the destruction of these Upadhis.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Like space appears divided by pots but is actually one, Brahman appears diverse due to limiting adjuncts (upadhis) like body/mind. When these are transcended, non-duality is realized.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Verse 11 -->
    <div class="verse-container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">11</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">Because of Its association with different conditionings (Upadhis) such ideas as caste, colour and position are super-imposed upon the Atman, as flavour, colour, etc., are super-imposed on water.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Attributes like caste or status are falsely attributed to the Atman due to its association with upadhis (limiting adjuncts), just as color/flavor seem to belong to water when actually from external sources.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class="flex items-start">
        <span class="verse-number">12</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">Determined for each individual by his own past actions and made up of the Five elements - that have gone through the process of "five-fold self-division and mutual combination" (Pancheekarana) - are born the gross-body, the medium through which pleasure and pain are experienced, the tent-of-experiences.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The gross physical body is formed by pancheekarana (five-fold combination of elements), shaped by past karma, and serves as the instrument for experiencing pleasure/pain in the world.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">The five Pranas, the ten organs and the Manas and the Buddhi, formed from the rudimentary elements (Tanmatras) before their "five-fold division and mutual combination with one another" (Pancheekarana) and this is the subtle body, the instruments-of-experience (of the individual).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The subtle body consists of: 5 pranas, 5 sense organs, 5 action organs, mind (manas), and intellect (buddhi) - all formed from tanmatras (subtle elements) before their gross combination. This is the experiencing mechanism.</p>
      </div>

        <span class="verse-number">14</span>

      </div>
      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The causal body is beginningless ignorance (avidya) itself. The true Self is distinct from all three bodies (gross, subtle, causal) which are merely conditioning factors (upadhis).</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <span class="verse-number">15</span>
        <p class="text-gray-200 flex-1">In its identification with the five-sheaths the Immaculate Atman appears to have borrowed their qualities upon Itself; as in the case of a crystal which appears to gather unto itself colour of its vicinity (blue cloth, etc.,).</p>

      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The pure Atman seems to take on qualities of the five sheaths (physical, vital, mental, intellectual, bliss) it's associated with, just as a clear crystal appears colored when placed on colored cloth.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="explanation mt-3">
        <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Through viveka (discrimination), one must discern the pure Self from its coverings (sheaths), like separating rice from husk. This analytical negation (neti-neti) reveals the true Self.</p>
